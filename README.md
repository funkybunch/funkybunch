## Hi there 👋 I'm Mark (He/Him)
### I do a little bit of everything in the world of software.
When I'm not designing things, I mostly write Javascript (front end & Node) and Python.

🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a space nerd.  Currently working on an open source release for a TLE-based satellite tracker.

Designer by day.  Home Automation nerd & integration maintainer/contributor to [Home Assistant/core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/) by night.
